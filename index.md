## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="profile.jpg">

Hi! I am Chaarvi Bansal. I am a pre-final year student at BITS Pilani, India, pursuing a dual degree in M.Sc.(Honours) Biological Sciences and B.E.(Honours) Computer Science. My research interests center around the application of deep learning in areas involving computational biology, bioinformatics and medicine. 

Currently, I am working under the supervision of Dr. Rohitash Chandra, University of New South Wales on a [COVID-19 Drug Repurposing](https://bioinformatics.csiro.au/blog/covid-19-drug-repurposing/) project at CSIRO Australia. Before this I was working on a greedy based De-Novo Genome Assembler at Advanced Data Analytics and Parallel Technologies Lab BITS Pilani. 

Recently, I have been awarded the MITACS Globalink Research Scholarship 2022 to work with Professor Kathrin Tyryshkin on the project titled <i> Modelling neuroendocrine neoplasms through graph neural networks and post-transcriptional gene regulatation </i> at Queen's University, Kingston. 

During the summer of 2020, I worked as a machine learning intern at North Eastern Space Application Center where I built a plugin that automated the process of semantic segmentation of satellite images in QGIS (Open Source GIS Application). 

Apart from this, I also like to read. Genius Makers by Cade Metz, Ikigai by Hector Garcia and The Silent Patient by Alex Michealides are some of my favourite books. My hobbies also include playing tennis and swimming.
