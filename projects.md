### **MRFF Covid-19 Drug Repurposing Project & FDA Covid-19 Systems Biology-AIML Project | [CSIRO Australia](https://bioinformatics.csiro.au/)**

*January 2021 - Present*  
*This project is funded by the FDA and the Australian government.*  
Working under the supervision of [Dr. Rohitash Chandra](http://rohitash-chandra.github.io/), [Professor S.S. Vasan](https://www.york.ac.uk/healthsciences/our-staff/honoraryemeritus/seshadri-vasan/) and, [Dr. Vinti Agarwal](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/vinti/profile). 
- Working with a team of international researchers to re-purpose drugs already approved for other diseases to fight COVID and its variants.  
- Employing multiomics approach to evaluate the biochemical utility of shortlisted compounds. 
- Responsible for designing the experiments and optimising the parameters involved using machine learning.

### **De-Novo Genome Assembler, Project Funding Period - 3 yrs | Mentor: [Dr. Poonam Goyal](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/poonam/profile)**

*January 2021 - December 2021*  
Did project type courses for two consecutive semesters at advanced data analytics and parallel technologies lab, BITS Pilani. 
- Implemented a two-level hash table structure to reduce the retrieval time and to make the algorithm easy to distribute and parallelize.
- Designed a structure, sequence vector to cap the memory requirement at 2x Insert Length/contig and reduced overhead memory cost. 
- Devised a maximum voting algorithm to increase the intermediate assembly length by 30%.
